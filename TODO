BUGS
====

- maybe keep dropdown open in LMBPressed mode even if the cursor goes
  outside of the selection box
- scrollbar: click-repeat bug -
    click & hold, wait until track is under the cursor, then click & hold
    at the opposite side of the track without leaving the widget
- scrollbar: click-hold doesn't work if the tooltip appeared

- textfield:
  - type really fast, movement keys are screwed
  - mouse select: selecting should have no delay until we hit the border of
    the textbox



TODO
====

- OS X specific shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-A = Select All on Win)
- value entry widget (modified slider)
- menus
- display tooltip based on screen position
- windows (e.g. modal popups)
- scroll wheel support
- keyboard support for dropdowns
- proper tooltip sizing/formatting (requires multi-line wrapping...)
- theming
- SweepCheckBox?

- "soft asserts" (check) that print errors to stderr instead of aborting
