BUGS
====

- tooltips are broken

- maybe keep dropdown open in LMBPressed mode even if the cursor goes
  outside of the selection box

- scrollbar:
  - click-repeat bug -
    click & hold, wait until track is under the cursor, then click & hold
    at the opposite side of the track without leaving the widget
  - click-hold doesn't work if the tooltip appeared

- textfield:
  - move cursor past the right edge when text doesn't fit into the the
    textfield - the cursor should be after the last character, not after the 
    one before the last

- textarea: get rid of two frame delay when exiting widget with ESC while the
  the cursor is over if (edit -> default -> hover state)

- dropdown: quickly click and move pointer down -> value select (put small
  delay in there, wait a few frames at least)


TODO
====

- OS X specific shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-A = Select All on Win)
- value entry widget (modified slider)
- display tooltip based on screen position
- proper tooltip sizing/formatting (requires multi-line wrapping...)
- scroll wheel support

- test shortcuts & widgets with capslock & numlock again

- test all textfield shortcuts with edge cases:
    - empty string
    - single space
    - 1 char, cursor at start
    - 1 char, cursor at end
    - >1 char, cursor at end

- test all textfield shortcuts with edge cases:
    - empty string
    - single space
    - single new line
    - two new line chars
    - 1 char, cursor at start
    - 1 char, cursor at end
    - >1 char, cursor at end
    - in first row
    - in last row
    - at first char
    - at last char

- keyboard support for dropdowns
- theming
- menus
- windows (e.g. modal popups)
- SweepCheckBox?

- "soft asserts" (check) that print errors to stderr instead of aborting

- set theme paramters globally (e.g. font, corner roundness, colours)
